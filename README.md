## 🤖 How It Was Built

I vibed-coded this project with a mix of:
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) (sometimes lovable, sometimes a little unhinged)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (for code, ideas, and rubber-ducking)
- **My own brain** (most of all)
- And a dash of [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the beautiful UI

Special thanks to the AI assistants,  
but every line was reviewed and tuned by me for pure AHL energy.
